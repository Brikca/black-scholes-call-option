# black-scholes-call-option
A simple project exploring the Black–Scholes formula for pricing European call options. This repository contains Python code, calculations, and visualizations used to understand how option prices behave under different market parameters. Developed as part of a course assignment during my studies at Universitas Gadjah Mada.
